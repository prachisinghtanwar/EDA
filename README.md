# US Accidents - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project explores a comprehensive dataset of over 2.8 million accident records across the US through detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). By analyzing key factors like accident location, weather, time, and severity, the project uncovers vital patterns and insights to inform data-driven strategies for improving road safety and traffic management.

## Project Goals

Uncover Accident Trends: Analyze the relationships between weather, location, time, and severity to find key patterns.
Identify Risk Factors: Determine high-risk areas and times, enabling targeted interventions to reduce accidents.
Visualize Key Insights: Use interactive visualizations to make complex data accessible and actionable for stakeholders.
Drive Safety Improvements: Provide insights that help policymakers and traffic managers implement effective safety measures.

## Key Findings

Weather Anomaly: Over 80% of accidents occurred during fair weather, shifting focus toward other factors like driver behavior and road conditions.
High-Risk Hotspots: Visualization tools like heatmaps and scatter plots helped identify high-risk locations and accident-prone times, guiding targeted safety measures.
Stakeholder Impact: The interactive dashboards, created with Plotly, empower traffic authorities and policymakers to make data-driven decisions that directly enhance road safety.

## Tools & Technologies

Pandas & NumPy: For data cleaning, manipulation, and exploration of accident records.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: To create static visualizations for quick insight into accident patterns.
Plotly: For developing interactive dashboards, enabling stakeholders to explore data and derive insights in real time.
